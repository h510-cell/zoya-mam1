      <p>Hello! today I will tell you about my teacher. Her name is Zoya Khan Shaikh. She is my teacher
          in coding classes . Today is her last day with me in my coding classes as she joining another 
          company. So let me talk something about her ,she is my mentor and my friend ,in every class 
          we do study and some talking of my cubes. We have so much doing classes but as she joining another company 
          it's our last class she also encouraged and also helped in my projects. She also gives me 
          guidence for how I should improve and because of her I could build this website and I could 
          also make some apps and games. So mam thank you for supporting me and giveing me  this much knowlegde about 
          coding. OK I would end this paragraph with a quote for teacher's 'Teaching is a calling too And I've always
          thought that teachers in their way are holy - angles leading their flocks out of darkness'said by Jeannette Walls.
          BYE BYE ZOYA MAM
